To be used of this life, I also tired to walk<br>
Increased to stop, and given up to start something<br>
I don’t know, but I wanted to<br>
What I wanted to, I don’t know<br>
A great guy said to me “do your best!”<br>
I’m fed up with it, it’s enough, I don’t need<br>
Your worthless word and your sweert word<br>
Crying and hurt<br>
I’m getting sick of breathing<br>
Maybe I’ll say like that, even now I’m always searching a word to run away<br>
I say like “Ah, I wonder if  it’s enough?”, “I wonder if it’s good enough?”<br>
Such as myself is not good right?<br>
I step back to the tomorrow that will come, I don’t have any sins, right?<br>
From the next time I think that the mask of lies has come off<br>
Ah, I don’t care about it anymore<br>
I say it from your back that become more distant<br>
“Goodbye”<br>
I was pretty good to decorate it, right<br>
I was glad that I arranged it beautiful<br>
In this kind of the world<br>
I realized that there is someone who can breathe in the water<br>
I have something that I always thought before<br>
I hate it, please help me<br>
Please give me sweet words and worthless words,<br>
You are Pharisee at all<br>
Even today I hold one’s temper, what should I live for?<br>
Next up, I think next up is made for chased something<br>
Ah it’s good, You got to be nice<br>
I looked to your back that I can’t reach<br>
I say like “Ah, I wonder if  it’s enough?”, “I wonder if it’s good enough, right?”<br>
It still be in time, right? Don’t leave me<br>
A prologue<br>
I step back to the tomorrow that will come, I don’t have any sins, right?<br>
From the next time I think that the mask of lies has come off<br>
I say like “Ah, I wonder if  it’s enough?”, “I wonder if it’s good enough?”<br>
Such as myself is not good right?<br>
I won’t forget it<br>
Even today I hold one’s temper, what should I live for?<br>
Next up, I think next up is made for chased something<br>
Ah it’s good, You got to be nice<br>
You and I are lost<br>
An unfinished prologue
