It was a little bit earlier<br>
Unattractive<br>
I thought it’d go well<br>
I was sure<br>
It would’ve been a happy ending story<br>
Like a scenario<br>
It should have been like<br>

My monologue<br>
I’m jealous<br>

But, it was fine<br>
You were so sly<br>
“today’s fortune-teller is not good”<br>

I want to stop, but i can’t<br>
My summer can’t catch you<br>
But,  i hope i can reach you tomorrow<br>
It seems like, i’m the child and you are an adult<br>
It would have been good without shoujo manga<br>
I lied<br>
There’s no other way, except tell a lie<br>
A lie that change from 2 words into 3 words<br>
The fireworks that we should see in the crowded train<br>
Now it’s on tv<br>
The credit,<br>
It should’ve been only two of us, you and me<br>
It’s a secret. hidden in my monologue, please hidden in it<br>
If there is someone noticed it, the autumn will pulling me towards
