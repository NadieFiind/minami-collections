I was stabbed to death by a clock needle<br>
The world has already been deceived by ruthless words<br>
You have a name, a face and a personality<br>
I believed the word of the unknown<br>
I lost my voice. i lost my left wing too<br>
Anonymous people laugh at sight of me falling down<br>
I am chaser<br>
I am chaser<br>
I am chaser<br>
I want to know the eternal blue<br>
I am chaser<br>
Those who do not reveal their names bemoan me<br>
But<br>
We will always return<br>
This is where we belong<br>
We will always return<br>
Return to eternal blue...<br>
I also wrote unexpectedly today «i’m fine»<br>
This world will be dominated by someday number<br>
I am not a fake or a puppet<br>
It's a human being. it's human. it's okay. i still have blood<br>
Even if you have only the right wing, you can not walk<br>
I need your help<br>
I shook my hand saying goodbye to myself<br>
I don’t want to alive (any more)<br>
I don’t want to alive (any more)<br>
I don’t want to alive (any more)<br>
Can i go away now?<br>
I lost the meaning of life<br>
I can not see tears anymore<br>
Many times. a few times and a few times. how many times. i did not save you if i did it again<br>
Like a reincarnation<br>
Let’s collect the light and reset all of this world<br>
You can cry<br>
You can laugh<br>
You can be angry<br>
I’ll be your heart<br>
I’ll be your heart<br>
Why did that scar?<br>
What do you know about me?<br>
Nothing left<br>
I did not do anything<br>
I tried, i tried<br>
I kept trying on my own<br>
I did not get anything<br>
It's not me. it's not me. it's not my fault<br>
I am chaser<br>
I am chaser<br>
I am chaser<br>
I wanted to know the eternal blue<br>
You are chaser<br>
I could not keep you because my feet did not fall<br>
But<br>
We will always return,<br>
Even if new waves come in again<br>
This is where we belong<br>
I will continue to fight<br>
We will always return,<br>
So that you do not disappear<br>
I will regain eternal blue
