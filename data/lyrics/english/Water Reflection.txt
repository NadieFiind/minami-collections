Sinking further and further<br>
I can’t see anything, i don't want to see anything anyway<br>
What a convenient world, isn't?<br>
How painful, even more than underwater<br>
The more you believe, the more you will be betrayed.<br>
I’m done living that way<br>
Isn’t this world weird?<br>
Why are you laughing? won’t crying be enough<br>
In a world where people who want to cry cant.<br>
What is it there to live for?<br>
Painful, painful, struggling, desperately<br>
So easily rejected, i can’t get through<br>
Even if there is no tomorrow, it is fine by me<br>
Nothing will change anyway<br>
My heart is about to tear up<br>
Why is it so painful?<br>
What am i lacking?<br>
Is it wrong to fake a laugh?<br>
I have no choice but to laugh<br>
Who made such a world?<br>
I want to laugh, i want to cry<br>
In this vast world where i do not belong<br>
What should i live for?<br>
Why are you laughing? won’t crying be enough<br>
In a world where people who want to cry cant.<br>
What is it there to live for?<br>
I want to laugh, i want to cry<br>
In this vast world where i do not belong<br>
What should i live for?<br>
Distrusting, full of lies, i am sinking deeper<br>
Drowning in this water reflection
