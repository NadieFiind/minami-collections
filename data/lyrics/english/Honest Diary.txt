Ah, why? do i do these things i wonder<br>
Ah, why? nothing but him/her, it's always him/her<br>
Because i'm already at my limit. ah, again.. with this.. look.. i went and said it again<br>
Things like getting hate from people are only words<br>
Says the one who's becoming truly alone<br>
Actually knowing what it is, and be it too (alone)<br>
What's next? looks like a tough time ahead<br>
Me with a clever mouth, i presently can't do anything<br>
I have no money, no love, but<br>
I'm fine with this<br>
I am. tomorrow and the day after. just a bystander<br>
Just that was fine. it was fine<br>
I'll just humor (trick) you with this crap, you said<br>
You are really such an idiot<br>
"i love you", such words are... lies<br>
Especially you young ladies who spout it all the time<br>
...yep...bull's eye.<br>
Be it a close friend, a partner, or just someone you don't care about<br>
You do it willfully<br>
It's really funny, look (sounds like it's not really funny)<br>
They look like they are piles of dust<br>
These words used to... violate<br>
Just as i realized. a person... understood the fever.<br>
Understood the ice so cold it's freezing to touch they both did<br>
One day i'll feel a pain. and one day, the scar will vanish as well<br>
I don't get it (there is no way/i don't know how)<br>
I'm fine with this<br>
I'm fine with this<br>
I'm fine with this<br>
I'm fine with this<br>
I'm fine with that<br>
Even with my rotting future too<br>
And at the end<br>
There was no choice but to grow up<br>
It's really bad...
