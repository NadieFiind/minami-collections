Inexperienced, heartless, even so, be beautiful.<br>
No destiny, I’m unworthy. If we talk like it’s not enough.<br>
“If it’s like this, then things will go well.”<br>
Things, money, love, words, I’m tired of self-asserting myself.<br>
Deja vu, what are you so unsatisfied about? You’ve said all sorts of selfish things. What more could you possibly want? But surprise, I don’t hate this situation.<br>
Already, “I’m sick of hearing that line.” I just hate only taking things halfway.<br>
Enough. Even if you say do this or that, “love me”, or “why”.<br>
It’s easy if’s just for fun.<br>
Serious talks are in vain.<br>
Those thoughtless and flimsy words, how many times do you want to use them?<br>
Anyway, I was hoping even in a fixed game, with all those phrases that get my hopes up. Let these things become taboo. Take a hint, don’t let it rain.<br>
I hate talking in a roundabout way. If you must speak, say it within two words. The red butterfly, can't even send a single message. Spreading a fragile folding fan. That is more attractive, isn’t it?<br>
If you’re Confused and can’t answer, or stop hesitating leave me alone. I say key words, but you don’t listen. If it’s only for the sake of peace of mind then fall, sweet raindrops. You also wanna hold the umbrella, right?<br>
Like this.<br>
With hopes confirmed I closed my eyes. I wanted to change to an adult. Lost, but I couldn’t rewind. Now, please don’t stop raining.<br>
Copy, paste, delete, and repeat. Breathe in, breathe out.<br>
So ahhh...<br>
Still...it doesn’t matter, this a heartache!<br>
Enough. Even if you say do this or that, “love me”, or “why”.<br>
It’s easy if’s just for fun.<br>
Serious talks are broken.<br>
Those thoughtless and heavy lies. Let all these things become taboo.<br>
Surely, I was hoping, even in a fixed race. Our official phrases will end our habit of running away. Take a hint, let it clear up.<br>
It's raining again today.<br>
I'll close my umbrella, and go home in the rain.
