A manga's protagonist said<br>
"I'll protect you"<br>
They were a really cool protagonist<br>
If it were me, I wonder if I'd just be "villager B" that runs away<br>
Without making one unpleasant face, smiling, crying in the shadows<br>
They fought, they saved people<br>
They were everyone’s favorite person<br>
They were a hero, it’s obvious<br>
If it were me I’d cling to and depend on the protagonist<br>
I wonder if I’d just be “villager C”<br>
I just waited for the morning without doing anything, alone on my bed<br>
While drinking a cup of soup<br>
While watching the same old news again in front of the television<br>
I waited again for the usual peace<br>
Just once, just once, just once, just once<br>
Give me proof that I exist<br>
Only me, only me, only me, only me<br>
Give me proof there’s something only I can do<br>
Even you, it’s the same, everybody, is waiting<br>
I’m singing probably because even I don’t know what that is<br>
I’ve grown tired of each day I thought of as ordinary things have come<br>
I hated things that were difficult, simplicity was better<br>
But for some reason the guitar in my room<br>
was the only thing I couldn’t throw away<br>
Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit<br>
I wanted even a square meter where I belonged<br>
Only me, only me, only me, only me<br>
I wanted to be someone’s number one<br>
It won’t change, it won’t change<br>
It can’t change, it can’t change<br>
‘Cause, just as I thought, this is how I am<br>
Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit<br>
I wanted even a square meter where I belonged<br>
Just once, just once, just once, just once<br>
Give me proof that I exist<br>
Only me, only me, only me, only me<br>
Give me proof there’s something only I can do<br>
Because it's me, because it's me, because it's me, even if I am how I am,<br>
Love me<br>
Forgive me
