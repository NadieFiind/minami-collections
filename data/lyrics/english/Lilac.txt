Some day’s voice is now continuing to make my heart cramp.<br>
It was like that right? It was like this right?<br>
Like a self-interpreting receiver.<br>
If not changed, getting bored of it.<br>
If it does change, “it did get changed right?”<br>
What are you on about? What’s up with that?<br>
It seems that the spear and shield are not gone.<br>
Happiness is a blurring defective eye shutter.<br>
Painful things appear delicately by a high resolution lens.<br>
I’ve done my best, not particularly for you or anything.<br>
Hey… it’s like that right?<br>
There is no allowance to live on, by doing things that don’t fit in life.<br>
High as life,<br>
before like life,<br>
life wisely,<br>
I would really like to live life like that but,<br>
it is exactly like a present in which relatively there is no proof nor any basis.<br>
Rough as life,<br>
tough as life,<br>
it would be good to have it like a game that looks like life right?<br>
There are even futures that I would like to bet on by pressing the A/B buttons.<br>
I think a hero’s private life is certainly good for nothing.<br>
Compared to a negative normal human being,<br>
you cannot afford to be deluded by the voices of others.<br>
Already more restless,<br>
already more unstable,<br>
because the written instructions will already certainly be made too beautiful.<br>
Contaminate it! Destroy it! The decided boring fixed concept that is, throw it away!<br>
Already practically no matter what else, with a killed voice that has been pushed too far.<br>
Thoughtlessly nodding your head to the things you do now want to do.<br>
Stop it! Raise you face!<br>
I do not want to be just the built-up imagination, by an ego of a human that ended up getting tired.<br>
Thinking that there was still some time, both the regret and the electrocardiogram that I did in front one’s eyes were mushy as they were.<br>
There is only one thing I think of,<br>
distress distress distress distress distress distress distress<br>
High as life,<br>
before like life,<br>
life wisely,<br>
the thing I really want it to change but,<br>
I do fit perfectly in the current world without any proof nor any basis.<br>
Rough as life,<br>
tough as life,<br>
I would really like to live in a game that looks like life.<br>
There are even futures that I would like to change by pressing the A/B buttons.
