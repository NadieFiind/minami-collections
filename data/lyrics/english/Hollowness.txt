You say "you can rest now"<br>
Thinking back now<br>
It is a sweet trap<br>
Today i will transformed into a ideal person<br>
Fiction, false words, virtue reflection, sincerity<br>
I made it by myself<br>
A honest person is boy who cried wolf<br>
Lies play with the victims<br>
Because this is the time to make a fake cry<br>
Ah, you have decided<br>
To escape<br>
From a 3d world like this, right?<br>
To virtualize a lie<br>
It’s a non-scientific situation and a imaginary ways of speech<br>
Whichever doesn't matter<br>
Give me love<br>
Love me<br>
Those words can't cure me anymore<br>
Stay by my side a little more<br>
The proof that i'm not satisfied with my life is<br>
This wound ... this wound<br>
Please, be my replacement<br>
My twins are in the mirror<br>
Nothing lasts forever in this world<br>
It doesn't matter if everything becomes fictitious<br>
Then i want to close my eyes<br>
Right?<br>
Lalala…..<br>
I leaned on the side of the balance<br>
You laugh at me, saying that "you don’t have place"<br>
Even though i want to go home, but i can't<br>
I didn't realize it<br>
One word's weight<br>
Become my sacrifice<br>
Where does my ideal shadow disappear<br>
With a completely different appearance<br>
You gave me a fake smile<br>
You’re going to soak up the lies<br>
Then you make a new lie and change it right?<br>
I can't be someone like you<br>
The ideal reflection that i created<br>
I want to destroy it,<br>
But i can't<br>
My ideal reflection isn't here<br>
Without any intention, i reached out<br>
Into my shadow<br>
To virtualize a lie<br>
It is a situation that is not real, the reflection is not here<br>
The disappearing boundary<br>
Give it back<br>
Come back<br>
I want to try it one more time<br>
My real self is here<br>
(that is wrong, wrong)<br>
Don't love my reflection<br>
Please don't forget me<br>
I promise i will think more about it<br>
"i will not lie to you again.<br>
You have my word."
