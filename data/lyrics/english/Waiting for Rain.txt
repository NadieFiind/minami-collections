We clung to old-school film<br>
It's like we were swallowed by the guiding clay and will harden someday<br>
The tax on words will leave us unsatisfied<br>
The rough draft I scribbled down to look for is softly, strongly being painted out<br>
This will be fine, surely, someone will be, I counted on an invisible person<br>
Ah, of course today is no good, either<br>
The dryness went beyond the finder<br>
Could you let the rain pour down on me?<br>
No matter how many times it's repainted, muddied up<br>
These lyrics won't be reaching you now<br>
The vague words I thought up<br>
I can amass them all together and it's still not enough<br>
It's like I really have died, haven't I?<br>
Becoming universal is like being ignored<br>
The rain<br>
Don't mix in with it<br>
Don't waste the liquid that gets overused<br>
That's what I want from you<br>
The things I loved were swallowed up by blue and disappeared<br>
No more of the would-be detective solving mysteries for cheap<br>
The rain going along the show windows dries up<br>
Before the darkness rises, soon<br>
I softly close out of the USB<br>
Someday, love the me from that day.<br>
I deceived you because of the rain<br>
Zero has become a little more lonely<br>
You won't come back a second time, you can't come back, you can't come home<br>
Hurry<br>
Hurry<br>
You have to hurry<br>
Until<br>
It becomes like this<br>
Holding out on breathing<br>
That screensaver that gets in the way<br>
I definitely don't want to forget.<br>
Tomorrow, if it's cloudy beyond the finder<br>
Won't you smile quietly for me?<br>
I hope our focus meets, I hope it isn't blurry<br>
I hope this lyric reaches you someday<br>
I compared too much<br>
It can't be helped that it's blue<br>
I tried to enchant you with my shoddy word tax<br>
The intracerebral hierarchy<br>
Let's say good night<br>
It's uncertain, but we always<br>
Timidly keep waiting<br>
The clock hand kept coming for me<br>
You, on the number beside me<br>
Will wait for me, right?<br>
It's okay if it's an illusion<br>
Of course today I'm no good, either<br>
Even if I pinch, it will only blur, I bet<br>
We were waiting for the dried rain
